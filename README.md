# $\text{Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm for Boolean Function}$
The Deutsch–Jozsa Algorithm is one of the fundamental quantum algorithms that demonstrates the advantage of quantum computation over classical computation. It is used to determine whether a Boolean function is constant or balanced. In the classical approach, the number of function evaluations grows exponentially with the size of the input. In contrast, the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm can solve this problem with a single evaluation by exploiting quantum superposition and interference. This algorithm serves as an important example in learning quantum algorithms and forms a foundation for modern quantum computing.

## $\text{Background}$
The development of quantum computing opens new opportunities for solving problems that are difficult or inefficient to handle using classical computation. One of the earliest algorithms that demonstrates this potential is the Deutsch–Jozsa Algorithm. This algorithm was introduced as a simple example to show how principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and interference, can be exploited to achieve computational advantages.

The Deutsch–Jozsa Algorithm is designed to determine whether a Boolean function is constant or balanced. In classical computation, multiple function evaluations are required to guarantee this property, especially as the input size increases. In contrast, using a quantum approach, the Deutsch–Jozsa Algorithm can provide a definite answer with only a single function evaluation. Therefore, this algorithm is commonly used as an introductory topic in the study of quantum algorithms and serves as a foundation for understanding more advanced concepts in quantum computing.

## $\text{Methodology}$
The Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm exploits quantum superposition and interference to evaluate a global property of a Boolean function. By encoding function values as phase information and applying Hadamard transformations, the algorithm deterministically distinguishes constant and balanced functions with a single oracle query.
